# Introduction
The BitcoinPaygate Payment Gateway API is a tool for merchants to allow clients to pay in Bitcoin while receiving fiat currencies to your bank account.

Our API uses REST and JSON as a primary way of communication.

The following actions are available through our API:

* Create new payment request
* Check payment request status
* Register callback to receive notification when the payment is completed
