# Testing

We provide a testing server which is a physically separate environment and it's running against Bitcoin testnet.  
For testing we recommend using either `bitcoin-qt` wallet in the testnet mode or [Bitcoin Wallet for Testnet](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.schildbach.wallet_test&hl=en), there is only version for Android.  

The testnet Bitcoins are free and can be requested on these websites:  
* http://tpfaucet.appspot.com/
* http://faucet.xeno-genesis.com/
* http://kuttler.eu/bitcoin/btc/faucet/

You can also get in touch with us and we'll send you testnet Bitcoins.

To see payment notifications you can use [Request Bin](http://requestb.in/) - just pass a generated URL as notification URL
